You tiredly walk to the local park. You notice a young, handsome, buff man talking to your grandma. Response?
Interrupt their conversation to say Hi to him
Grandma: “Huh… hello? Oh, Hi Grandson!” New Guy: "Oh hey there."

Wait patiently for them to end before saying Hi
They end up talking for a couple hours. You wait... and wait... and wait... and wait... and wait... and wait... and wait... and wait.  You take a nap for thirty minutes and wake up to them still talking. They finally see you after 3 hours.

"Oh hey Granny! What happened to Grandpa?"
Grandma "Hmm... What did you sayyy? Are you talking about him? His name is Huberte, and we were just talking about earthquakes. Why don't you join?"

Push him aside to talk to your grandma (Choose another place)
"Grandma!!!!!!!!!!" Grandma: "Ohh!!! Grandson!" The guy, obviously hurt, looks in disgust as he walks away. After talking with your grandma for a bit, you walk off with absolutely no guilty conscious.

New Guy introduces himself “Hail. Name’s Huberte, starts with a H and ends with an E. I was taking my daily jogging route when I saw your grandma. She looked like someone I just ahd to talk to."
"Hay-soos, you’re creepy"
Huberte smiles, ‘I’m friendly’
‘Usual daily new jogging route?’
Ya, I have a hard time trying to keep a set route, so I change it up. Daily.
‘How sweet of you for thinking about me mama’s mama!’
H. smiles ‘Ya, it’s no problem! Keeping elderly company is my duty!’
‘Wow, I wish I was as interactive as you.’
H. smiles, ‘It’s not hard, just need some motivation to meet people!’

Huberte: "Ok. Now that we are done with introductions, we can continue. You know speaking of earthquakes, I love forks.  Forks, Forks Forks. Especially the fork between beliefs." It looks like he wants you to respond. What do you do?
Ignore him and pull out your AirPods to listen to ‘Stacy’s Mom’ by Fountains of Wayne.
Grandma looks at you, "Darn grandson with your new fancy ear ring. Good thing you aren’t a teeny bopper, Hubert." Hubert: "Yeah."

"Yeah, I prefer sporks. They keep you from poking zee eye out."
Hubert: "Sporks? Why would anyone want to use useless utensils?" Grandma: "Ohhh... Even I don't support sporks."

"Umm... What fork between beliefs?"
Hubert: "Oh. Just the one between relations of ideas and matters of fact. One remains true for all eternity while the other depends on kairos." "Huh. Interesting, I guess."

"Umm... What's a fork?"
Hubert: "Well, a fork mainly consists of a handle and three tines, or spikes. It is used to stab and pick up food. Not sure why you don't know but there you go."

H. asks ‘Care to join me on my adventure?’
‘Fuck off psychopath’
H. frowns, ‘just trying to be friendly…’
‘Count me in!’
H. grins ‘Alright follow me!’
‘Sounds interesting… Can I join you tomorrow?’
H smiles, ‘I’ll hold you to it!’
‘Tempting, but I’ll pass.’
H frowns, ‘Suit yourself, guess granny and me are going.’

You join H. on his jog as he starts saluting to everyone he sees, but he starts to suddenly ignore you, what will you do?
‘Hey H. why do you salute to every person we pass?’
‘Who are you?’
‘How you feeling H.?’
‘Fine… who are you?’
‘Umm H.?’
‘Umm do I know you?
‘Yo H. wanna take a break at that Taco Bell?’
‘What is that and who are you?!’

H. responds confused. What will you do now?
‘Wh-? Bu- We- I- U- gra-  What da ya mean?’
H. looks solemnly, ‘Look. I’m just jogging here. If you want, you can join me.’
‘I’m your gf! You said we were going to Prom together and you were going to buy the TICKETS!’
H. looks shocked, ‘Shoot! Did i forget?! Sorry about that, I’ll make it up to you!’
Slip your card into his pants
H. looks more confused
Walk away while slouching
H. shrugs and jogs off
