You tiredly walk to the local park. You notice a young, handsome, buff man talking to your grandma. Response?
Interrupt their conversation to say Hi to him
Grandma: “Huh… hello? Oh, Hi Grandson!” New Guy: "Oh hey there."
1
Wait patiently for them to end before saying Hi
They end up talking for a couple hours. You wait... and wait... and wait... and wait... and wait... and wait... and wait... and wait.  You take a nap for thirty minutes and wake up to them still talking. They finally see you after 3 hours.

"Oh hey Granny! What happened to Grandpa?"
Grandma "Hmm... What did you sayyy? Are you talking about him? His name is Huberte, and we were just talking about earthquakes. Why don't you join?"

Push him aside to talk to your grandma (Choose another place)
"Grandma!!!!!!!!!!" Grandma: "Ohh!!! Grandson!" The guy, obviously hurt, looks in disgust as he walks away. After talking with your grandma for a bit, you walk off with absolutely no guilty conscious.

New Guy introduces himself: “Hail. Name’s Huberte, starts with a H and ends with an E. I was taking my daily jogging route when I saw your grandma. She looked like someone I just had to talk to." What should you say?
"Hay-soos, you’re creepy"
Huberte smiles, "Don't worry. I’m friendly"

"Daily jogging route?"
Huberte: "Ya, I have a hard time trying to keep a set route, so I change it up. Daily."

"How sweet of you for thinking about my mama’s mama!"
Huberte smiles: "Ya, it’s no problem! Keeping elderly company is my duty!"

"Wow, I wish I was as interactive as you."
Huberte smiles: "It’s not hard, just motivate yourself to meet people!"

Huberte: "Ok. Now that we are done with introductions, we can continue. You know speaking of earthquakes, I love forks.  Forks, Forks Forks. Especially the fork between beliefs." It looks like he wants you to respond. What do you do?
Ignore him and pull out your AirPods to listen to ‘Stacy’s Mom’ by Fountains of Wayne.
Grandma looks at you, "Darn grandson with your new fancy ear thing. Good thing you aren’t a teeny bopper, Huberte." Huberte: "Yeah."

"Yeah, I prefer sporks. They keep you from poking zee eye out."
Huberte: "Sporks? Why would anyone want to use such useless utensils?" Grandma: "Uhhh... Even I don't support sporks."

"Umm... What fork between beliefs?"
Huberte: "Oh. Just the one between relations of ideas and matters of fact. One remains true for all eternity while the other depends on kairos." "Huh. Interesting, I guess."

"Umm... What's a fork?"
Huberte: "Well, a fork mainly consists of a handle and three tines, or spikes. It is used to stab and pick up food. Not sure why you don't know but there you go."

Grandma: "I think that's it for me. I think I'll head home now." Huberte:"Care to join me on my adventure?"
"Fork off psychopath"
Huberte frowns, "just trying to be friendly…". He runs off while you wonder why you just succumbed to the pressure from the game makers.

"Count me in!" (choose 1 because of the fork pun)
Huberte grins "Alright follow me!"

"Sounds interesting… Can I join you tomorrow?" (Plz, 1 for the fork pun)
Huberte smiles, "I’ll hold you to it!". The next day,

"Tempting, but I’ll pass." (Why are you looking at the other options? 1 is the best)
Huberte frowns, "Suit yourself, guess I'll be going then."

you join Huberte on his jog. As he runs, you notice that he starts yelling "Forks" at everyone he sees. What should you do?
"Hey Huberte why do you yell at every person we pass?"
Huberte: "We must educate the masses. The people must understand the fork!"

"Are you OK, Huberte?"
Huberte: "I'm fine… how about you?" You just decide to drop it after that.
-1
"Ah, yes. If I knew the great distinction between truths, I would share it too."
Huberte: "Wow, someone finally understands!"

"Yo Huberte wanna take a break at that Taco Bell?"
"What is Taco Bell? And why do you want to stop now?"

Huberte suddenly stops and turns to you. "Wait. Before we continue, I need to ask you. Do you truly know the fork?" What will you do say?
"Wh-? Bu- We- I- U- gra-  What da ya mean?’"
Huberte looks solemnly, "Look. If you don't know, then I have to go." He runs off, leaving you alone ... cold ... sad.

"The fork between relations of ideas and matters of fact?"
Huberte: "You got it! You know what? I should get your number." You exchange numbers and after a bit more running, you part ways.

"The fork you use to eat?"
Huberte: "Not quite, but good try. Maybe if we talk more, you'll eventually get it. I need to go right now. How 'bout we trade numbers?" You exchange numbers and then he runs off.

"Didn't you just tell me about it?"
Huberte shrugs, "Probably, but it's just so interesting. We should talk about it more later. Why don't we trade numbers?" You exchange numbers and after a bit more running, you part ways.
