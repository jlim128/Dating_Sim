Milk Tea Bar

Arthur somewhat likes you; close enough.
Arthur went back to being Sad Boi. :(

You walk into the milk tea bar and watch a Sad Boi order an extra extra large milk tea with 500% sugar. $He sits down and sighs, then chugs his milk tea.
Get 500% sugar as well and sit next to him
Sad Boi: "You too?"$"Yeah..."
1
Get 25% sugar and sit next to him
The Sad Boi shifts slightly away from you
-1
Just sit down next to him
The Sad Boi nods slightly
0
Leave (pick another place)
You walk out as the Sad Boi continues to look sad. :(

Arthur: "Hey. My name's Arthur." He sighs. To get to know Arthur better, you decide to ask him a question. What do you ask?
"What’s your favorite color?"
Arthur: "Gray, like my soul" "Wow, how dramatic."
1
"Do you stir with a little spoon?"
Arthur: "What kind of question is that?" You decide to just drop it.
-1
"So, what do you like?"
"Well, I dabble in a bit of philosophy."
1
"I’m looking for a male for prom. Respond now."
Arthur: "Uh... I don’t even know you." Arthur looks super uncomfortable, and after a couple seconds he gets up and leaves.

He sighs again and takes a giant gulp from his boba with 500% sugar. How do you respond? 
"We’ve been talking for a bit now, do you have any plans after this?"
Arthur: "Plans? Well all I know right now is that I will suffer."
0
"Why 500%?"
Arthur: "Because life is suffering, only 500% can somewhat alleviate my pain for a moment"
0
"I’m interested in philosophy, can you tell me more about it?"
Arthur: "Ah yes.  I’m currently reading a piece right now called “The Earth as Will and Representation”.$It’s about life and its inherent suffering, as well as much more."
1
"I come here often and this is my first time seeing you. Any recommendations for good drinks?"
Arthur: "Get whatever you want ... either way you will suffer"

Arthur: "What do you believe about this world?"
"The usual. God(or gods, or no gods just to be PG), salvation, that kind of stuff"
Arthur: "Pshh... Like salvation actually exists..."
-1
“This world... is full of light...”
Arthur: “What a bunch of B.S. (which stands for butterfly stallions of course)”
-1
"There is no room in hell for me."
Arthur: "Umm... What? I have no idea what that even means."
0
"What is worth believing in?"
Arthur: "OMG (not oh my god but omg, just omg), I know.  What a terrible world we live in."$His face brightens up for a second before slumping back down.

Arthur: "How do you plan to roam this world?"
"I walk... a lonely road, the only one that I have ever known.”
Arthur: "Don’t know where it goes, but it’s only me, and I walk alone"
1
"Alone. Dead. Maybe go to prom before that though."
Arthur: "Same, but probably not the last part.”
1
"I don’t roam... I limp."
Arthur: “Sounds on par with everyone else in this dreaded world.”
1
"I want to travel across the world and explore all the wonders of life!"
Arthur: “Psh... What wonders?”

You suddenly feel the urge to pee after drinking so much milk tea. What do you do?
“Gotta take a shi shi break bro”.
Arthur: “Sure, I’ll wait then.” You go to the bathroom and then come back.
1
“Can you hold? I need a moment.”
Arthur: “Go right ahead.” You go to the bathroom and then come back.
0
Hold it in.
Arthur starts to ramble about his life and how it’s a dirty world, but you can't focus on what he's saying because ... it's ... just ... too ... painful.$You sprint to the bathroom, but when you come back, Arthur is nowhere to be seen.
-10000
Say “Ah man... I have to go right now...”
Arthur: “Eh... ok." He waits as you head to the bathroom.

Arthur starts to fidget, and starts staring off in the distance. Response?
"You ok? What’s wrong?"
Arthur: “Yeah… I’m fine.  Thanks for asking."
1
"I activate my trap card!"
Arthur snaps back and then proceeds to stare at you, completely lost, “What are you even talking about?"$"I'm sorry. I just heard response and instinctively did that."
-1
Wave your hand in front of his face.
Arthur: "Oh, sorry. Just lost myself for a moment there"
1
“That 500% kicking in?”
Arthur says nothing, but starts fidgeting more.

After what seems like hours of discussion in anime time (which is only minutes in Pacific Eastern Time), it’s time to make a decision.
"Hey, you (Pikachu)! Give me your phone number!"
Arthur sighs, "I guess. So aggressive though..." You exchange numbers, and after a bit more talking, you part ways.
-1
"It seems like you need someone to talk to every once in a while. Here's my number. I'm here for you if you need it."
Arthur sighs, "Thanks, I guess..." You exchange numbers, and after a bit more talking, you part ways.
1
"I think I'll just go now."
Arthur sighs, "OK, see ya ... I guess ..." You walk out and head home.
-3
"Here’s my card, I’ll call you sometime soon."
Arthur sighs, "Hwhy not..." You exchange numbers, and after a bit more talking, you part ways.
