You walk into the library and see that a debate is going on.  Aris, who you know from a couple classes, is on stage.  You watch for a couple minutes as he absolutely destroys his opponent with his mad logic skills.  Aris walks off stage, very clearly pleased with his performance. You approach him and say:
“Wow. Marvelous job!”
Aris: “Thank you madam! You are too kind.”
2
“HIIIIIIIIIIII”
Aris: “ umm… hi there”
-1
“Sup dude.”
Aris ignores you and keeps walking on.
-3
Leave (pick another place)

You start to walk alongside him as you introduce yourself and he introduces himself.  You come to a point where you want to know more about him

Choice:
“So what is your favorite color?”
Gold, it just has that fantastic sheen
“What do you enjoy doing?”
A. goes off on a super long tangent about what enjoyment is to end up with going on super long tangents as his pleasure
“So I heard you believe in geocentrism … “
A. sputters and then absolutely denies it, affirming that he was always right
“Do you always win these debates?”
A. deadstares, “Yes, ALWAYS”

As you’re walking alongside A., you notice that he’s heading towards a guy. What needs to be done?
Glare at the guy.
The guy gets scared and runs away. A. notices this and starts to glare at you.
Stare at the guy and ask , Como estassssss?
The guy and A. stare at you, awestrucked.
Ask A. who the guy is.
A. responds, “Oh, it’s my mortal enemy, Dave. We actively chat a lot.
Wave to the guy and say “Hail!”
A. whispers in a low voice, ‘very medieval’

The guy, Dave(unlock if you ask for name), says “Hail.” then starts laughing hysterically and says “Retired debater to women persuader?! :P”
“Wanna fuck with me?”
A. adds ‘A little much, but you got the idea.’
“I hope you realize that I confronted A. out of curiosity.”
A. raises an eyebrow , ‘Wow.. you’re acting a lot different…’
Glare at him
A. looks at you, ‘Hey, no need to be hostile to fellow debaters.’
Laugh it off and respond with “What do you mean?”
A. adds ‘Ya, your conclusion about us is highly inaccurate, I would think you, Dave would come up with something a bit more creative.’

After conversing with Dave for a while, A. walks away. What do you do?
Ask for Dave’s number
Dave responds, ‘I don’t date easily influenced people.’
Push Dave aside, and ask A. for his number
A. shifts his eyes away, ‘Do you respond like that to every male?’
Throw your card at A. and say, ‘Call me up the next debate!’
A. waves his hand as he walks away, ‘I’ll hold you to it.’
Slide your card into Dave’s pocket, then chase after A., and holler ‘WAIT!’
Dave looks at you in disgust while A. looks at you with fear.
