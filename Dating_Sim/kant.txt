Initial Impression:  You walk by the quad to see K. arguing with his friend for lying.  He storms off.

Storyline:  
Choice:
“Hey! Why are you so mean to your friend?”
K. roars, ‘He’s a GOT’ DAMN CUNT!’
Try to ignore the situation
You ‘On to a life of no drama…’
“Thank you! I hate that guy!”
K. agrees, ‘I know right?! Jake is such a liar!’
Leave (Choose another place)

K. starts rambling off about his beliefs of principles. How do you react?
Calm him down and pat him on the ass ‘it’s ok bro, as long as you’re true to yourself then nothing is wrong.’
K. blushes, ‘Ummm a bit weird.’ (He seems to calm down though)
Distract him ‘So what do you plan to do now?’
K yells, ‘I plan to fuck over Jake!’
Rile him up ‘Ya Fuck Those Sluts, let’s do something about their behavior. No, let’s do something about all these teenie boppers in this school!’
K agrees, ‘ya.. Get it right… or pay the price!’
‘Can I do anything to help give you peace of mind?’
K. grins, ‘Yes… you can help me confront Jake after school about the truth…’

K. says ‘I’m feeling better now, but I don’t know what do now… Any ideas?
‘I’m looking for a mate. For Prom.’
K seems nervous, ‘Ummm… I’ll think about it.’
‘I don’t know, what do you wanna do?’
K. tsks, ‘Why so much ass kissing?’
‘I’m feeling pretty hunger, want to go eat something?’
K. agrees, ‘Sounds good, I forgot to eat after getting so angry.’
‘Fuck off, you know what you want.’
K. thinks, ‘Oh ya, I have to do that thing!’ 
v
K. asks ‘Want to come with me to the counselor's office with me? I need to ask for a work permit.’
‘Sure!’
K. smiles, ‘great! Thanks for coming!’
‘I’ll wait outside.’
K. replies, ‘Ya, that’s fine as well.’
‘No, I have workafobia.’
K. frowns, ‘Wow. Asshole.’
‘Where are you working?’
K. answers, ‘I’m going to be working at Taco Bell.’

As K. gets his work permit, he says ‘Hey, how about you apply to Taco Bell with me?’ (You are originally from Indonesia and were apart of DACA, but the senate didn’t make any new laws to protect you when Trump reluctantly removed DACA. SO now you're not eligible for a work permit.
‘No, I have workafobia.’
K. shakes his head
‘I can’t because i’m an illegal immigrant.’
K. replies, ‘Oh shit that sucks.’
‘Sure! I’m down!’
K. grins, ‘Thanks for the support.’
‘Give me some time to think about it.’
K answers, ‘Ya, no problem, it’s a sudden request.’

After leaving the counselor’s office, the lunch bell rings.
‘Already?! Welp I’m outtie bro’
K. waves to you, ‘Have a good one!’
‘Hey. I had a fun time. I would like to continue this conversation later so… can i get your phone number?’
K grins, ‘Ya. Here you go! I’ll catch you later!’
‘Not gonna lie, you’re too goodie 2 shoes for me… I would recommend that you fuck off from now on.’
K. starts to slouch, ‘Ya hate to see it…’
‘Slip your card into his breast pocket and strut away.’
K. nervously shouts, ‘I’ll call you after school!’
