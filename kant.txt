Quad

Your principles appealed very much to Kmanuel.
Kmanuel didn't like your wishy-washyness

You walk by the quad to see a lengthy buff boi in his prime arguing with his friend. Buff Boi: "WHY THE HELL WOULD YOU LIE?!?!?!"  He turns away and storms off. You walk up to him. What do you say?
"Hey! Why are you so mean to your friend?"
Buff Boi: "He�s a GOT� DAMN LIAR!"

"Yo! Chill out man!"
Buff Boi: "NO! I'M ENJOYING MY ANGER!"

�Thank you! I hate that guy!�
Buff Boi: "I know right?! Such a liar!"

Walk off (Choose another place)
You awkwardly shuffle away as fast as you had approached him. Buff Boi: "Who was that?"

Kmanuel: "I haven't seen you before. The name's Kmanuel, with a silent k. Hoof. I�m feeling better now." How do you react?
Pat him on the bumbum "it�s ok bro, as long as you�re true to yourself then nothing is wrong."
Kmanuel blushes: "Ummm a bit weird."

"So what do you plan to do now?"
Kmanuel: "I plan to right the wrong that Jake has done, but otherwise nothing much!"

"Let�s do something about their behavior, those liars and cheaters. No, let�s do something about all these teenieboppers in this school!"
Kmanuel "Yes.. All these people should have a little more principle to them!"

"Can I do anything to help give you peace of mind?"
Kmanuel: "Yes you can help by always telling the truth. Stick to your principles, or I will get angry."

Kmanuel: "Well I don�t know what to do at the moment ... Any ideas?"
"I�m looking for a mate. For Prom."
Kmanuel: "Ummm... I don't even know you."

"I don�t know, what do you wanna do?"

"I�m feeling pretty hungers, want to go eat something?"
Kmanuel: "Sounds good, I forgot to eat after getting so angry." You both go to Taco Bell and get some tacos from Justin. On the way back,

"You know what you want, as long as you believe in yourself. Do your duty and follow your heart."
Kmanuel: "Hmm ... Oh ya, I have to do that thing!"

Kmanuel asks, "Want to come with me to the counselor's office with me? I need to ask for a work permit."
"Sure! I'm glad they have permits so us children don't get exploited."
Kmanuel smiles, "I know! It's great! Thanks so much for coming!"

"Yeah, whatever. I�ll just wait outside."
Kmanuel: "OK, that�s fine as well."

"No, I don't think kids should work. I'm just kidding, I'll go with you."
Kmanuel frowns: "Wow. Asshole. Lying to me."

"Where are you working?"
Kmanuel: "I�m going to be working at Taco Bell."

As Kmanuel gets his work permit, he says "Hey, how about you apply to Taco Bell with me?"
"No, I have workafobia."
Kmanuel shakes his head. Kmanuel: "You're going to have to work someday."

"I can�t because I�m an illegal immigrant. I'm originally from Indonesia and was a part of DACA, but the Senate didn�t make any new laws to protect me when Trump removed DACA.$So now I'm not eligible for a work permit."
Kmanuel: "Big rip. Darn that sucks."

"Sure! I�m down!"
Kmanuel: "Thanks for the support."

"Give me some time to think about it."
Kmanuel: "Ya, no problem, it�s a sudden request."

"I gotta go, but before that I need to tell you something. Not gonna lie, but you're kinda weird."
Kmanuel: "At least your honest. We should talk more so that I can improve. Here's my number."

Slip your card into his pocket and strut away.
Kmanuel: "I�ll call you after school, maybe!"
