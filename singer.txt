The soup kitchen closes and both of you walk outside and head to a nearby pond. Suddenly, you see a little girl fall in and start to struggle to stay afloat! What do you do?
Jump in without caring about your fancy shoes to save the girl immediately.
You dive right in, but your feet hit the bottom of the pond very quickly, rattling your legs.$You wade in slowly and take what feels like forever to lift the girl out. Your phone's all wet after that, so you have Rudolph call 911.$Rudolph: "Thank you. You did the right thing." You shiver a bit, and your legs start aching from your dive. The paramedics arrive shortly and handle the situation.
